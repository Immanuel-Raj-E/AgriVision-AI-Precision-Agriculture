# 🌱 AgriVision AI – Precision Agriculture System

AgriVision AI is an AI-powered precision agriculture platform that leverages satellite and drone imagery, machine learning, and weather data to monitor crop health and provide optimized, field-level farming recommendations.

The system helps farmers detect early crop stress, reduce resource wastage, and improve agricultural productivity in a sustainable manner.

---

## 🚜 Problem Statement
Traditional farming practices rely heavily on manual inspection and uniform application of resources such as water, fertilizers, and pesticides. This leads to:
- Late detection of pest infestations
- Overuse of fertilizers and pesticides
- Inefficient irrigation
- Increased costs and environmental impact
- Reduced crop yield

There is a need for a data-driven solution that enables precise and timely interventions.

## 🎯 Solution Overview
AgriVision AI uses artificial intelligence to analyze satellite or drone imagery and identify early signs of:
- Pest infestation
- Nutrient deficiency
- Water stress

By integrating weather data and vegetation indices like NDVI, the platform provides targeted recommendations for fertilizer, pesticide, and irrigation application.
